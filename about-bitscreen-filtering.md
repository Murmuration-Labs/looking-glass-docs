## About BitScreen Filtering

BitScreen is a distributed file filtering system for Filecoin Network Storage Providers. Its aim is to give Storage Providers on the Filecoin Network granular control over files being stored and retrieved through their Lotus node. Using BitScreen, a Storage Provider can choose to prevent storage and retrieval deals related to specified CIDs, in order to mitigate the risk of hosting potentially illegal or otherwise high-risk content.

For more information, see the [BitScreen Readme](https://github.com/Murmuration-Labs/bitscreen/blob/master/README.md) & the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Murmuration-Labs/bitscreen/blob/master/bitscreen_installation_guide.md) for node operators.

The [BitScreen cloud-based list manager](https://bitscreen.co/) is available for use [here](https://bitscreen.co/).
