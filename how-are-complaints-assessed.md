## How are complaints assessed?

Complaints regarding content hosted on the Filecoin network are reviewed by qualified assessors, who attempt to determine whether the submitted complaint is apparently valid on its face (e.g., includes all the required elements, and appears to have been submitted in good faith). 

Assessors review the CIDs (unique identifiers for files stored on the Filecoin network) within the context of the complaint and any applicable laws or policies, and may accept or reject individual CIDs submitted with a complaint. Assessors may optionally add accepted CIDs to a filter list which they manage using the [BitScreen app](https://github.com/Murmuration-Labs/looking-glass-docs/blob/main/about-bitscreen-filtering.md). Individual assessors may have additional analysis or policies which they perform as part of their assessments, which they will generally publish on their websites.

Node operators running hosting services on the Filecoin network may then choose to subscribe to lists run by assessors, and items with CIDs matching those on filter lists will be automatically rejected from storage and retrieval deals.
